# Data-Science-Journey
Welcome to my personal journey in mastering Data Science! I made this repository with Grok 4. The syllabus in this repository is inspired by top Bachelor's-level program (Stanford, UC Berkeley, Northeastern). I'll document all the steps I took. Each course has a dedicated folder with Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and progress trackers.
